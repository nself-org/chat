## Rationale for Cleanup

These files are temporary artifacts from development and QA sessions. 
They represent session notes, task completions, and verification reports 
that are no longer needed for production. The essential documentation 
remains in:
- docs/README.md
- docs/Features-Complete.md
- docs/Roadmap.md
- docs/PARITY-MATRIX-v091.md
- docs/releases/v0.9.1/reports/IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT-V0.9.1.md
- docs/releases/v0.9.1/reports/V0.9.1-QUALITY-REPORT.md
- All API references, guides, security docs (non-report files)
