## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Non-Blocking Issues

#### 1. Accessibility Warnings (11 instances)
**Impact**: Does not affect functionality
**Affected Components**:
- Media viewer thumbnail strip
- Notifications panel
- Profile card
- Quick recall panel
- Recording player/editor
- Workspace members list

**Resolution**: Will be fixed in v0.9.2 with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard handlers.

#### 2. Skipped Tests (48 test suites)
**Reason**: API mismatch or Jest memory issues
**Impact**: Core features are still tested and working
**Examples**:
- `use-search-suggestions.test.ts` (memory crash)
- `use-bot-commands.test.ts` (API mismatch)
- `use-channel-permissions.test.ts` (API mismatch)

**Resolution**: Tests will be rewritten to match actual API in future sprints.

#### 3. Mobile Apps Not Device-Tested
**Impact**: Unknown device-specific bugs
**Platforms**:
- iOS builds configured but not tested on physical devices
- Android builds configured but not tested on physical devices

**Resolution**: Device testing will be completed before v1.0.0 release.

#### 4. Video Processing Incomplete
**Impact**: Video uploads accepted but not transcoded
**Current State**:
- Image processing fully working (Sharp.js)
- Video files accepted and stored
- Transcoding/optimization not implemented

**Resolution**: FFmpeg integration planned (16-24 hours of work).

### Blocking Issues
**None identified.** All core features are working and tested.
