2. Mark as "Pre-release"
3. Copy release notes from CHANGELOG.md
4. Attach build artifacts (if available)
5. Link to documentation

## Deployment Steps

### Staging Environment
1. Deploy to staging: `pnpm deploy:staging`
2. Smoke test critical paths:
   - [ ] User authentication
   - [ ] Channel creation
   - [ ] Message sending/receiving
   - [ ] File uploads
   - [ ] Real-time updates
3. Monitor logs for errors
4. Check Sentry for exceptions

### Production Deployment (Hold for RC)
**DO NOT deploy to production until RC testing is complete**

1. Backup database
2. Deploy via CI/CD or manual
3. Run database migrations
4. Verify health checks
5. Monitor metrics for 24 hours

## Rollback Procedures

### If Critical Issues Found
1. Revert git tag: `git tag -d v0.9.1-rc.1 && git push --delete origin v0.9.1-rc.1`
2. Roll back deployment to previous version
3. Document issues in GitHub Issues
4. Create RC2 with fixes

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Docker rollback
docker rollback nself-chat:0.9.0

# Kubernetes rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nself-chat

# Database rollback
psql -f migrations/rollback/0.9.1-rc.1.sql
```

## Post-Release Monitoring

### Metrics to Watch (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Error rate (Sentry)
- [ ] Response times (APM)

- [ ] User authentication success rate
- [ ] File upload success rate

### Health Checks
