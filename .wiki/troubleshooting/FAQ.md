## General

### What is ɳChat?

ɳChat is a production-ready, white-label team communication platform built with Next.js 15 and React 19. It provides Slack/Discord/Telegram-like functionality with complete customization options.

### What does "white-label" mean?

White-label means you can completely customize the branding, theme, features, and deployment. The 12-step setup wizard lets you configure everything without touching code.

### Is ɳChat free?

Yes! ɳChat is open-source under the MIT License. You can use it freely for commercial or personal projects.

### What's the relationship with ɳSelf?

ɳChat is a demo project showcasing the [ɳSelf CLI](https://nself.org) backend infrastructure. While fully functional, it's designed to demonstrate ɳSelf's capabilities.

### How does ɳChat compare to Slack/Discord?

ɳChat provides feature parity with major platforms:

- **78+ features** across messaging, channels, files, users, and integrations
- **Self-hosted** - full control over your data
- **White-label** - complete branding customization
- **Open source** - modify anything you need

## Installation & Setup

### What are the minimum requirements?

- **Node.js**: 20 or higher
- **pnpm**: 9 or higher
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Disk**: 2GB free space
- **OS**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL2)

### How long does setup take?

Initial setup takes **under 5 minutes**:

1. Clone repository (30 seconds)
2. Install dependencies (2-3 minutes)
3. Start dev server (30 seconds)
4. Complete setup wizard (1-2 minutes)

### Do I need Docker?

Docker is **optional** for development. The setup wizard can:

- Use Docker for backend services (recommended)
- Connect to existing services
- Skip backend for frontend-only development

### Can I skip the setup wizard?

Yes! Pre-configure via environment variables and set `SKIP_WIZARD=true`. The wizard auto-detects existing config and skips completed steps.

### How do I reset the setup wizard?

```bash
# Clear configuration
rm -f .env.local
localStorage.removeItem('app-config')  # In browser console

# Or via API
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/config
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "Module not found"

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf .next node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### "Port 3000 already in use"

```bash
# Find and kill process
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use different port
PORT=3001 pnpm dev
```

### TypeScript errors after update

```bash
# Regenerate types
pnpm db:types

# Clear TypeScript cache
rm -rf .next tsconfig.tsbuildinfo
pnpm type-check
```

### GraphQL connection fails

Check backend services:

```bash
cd .backend
nself status

# Restart if needed
nself restart
```

### Authentication not working

**Development mode**:

```bash
# Ensure dev auth is enabled
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_DEV_AUTH=true" >> .env.local
```

**Production mode**:

```bash
# Check auth service
curl https://auth.yourdomain.com/healthz
```

### Images not loading

```bash
# Check Next.js image optimization
# In next.config.js:
images: {
  domains: ['your-storage-domain.com'],
  formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
}
```

### WebSocket connection drops

Check Nginx configuration for WebSocket upgrade:

```nginx
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
```
