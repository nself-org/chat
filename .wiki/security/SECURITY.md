### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] XSS vulnerability in message rendering

Description:
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the message
rendering component that allows attackers to execute arbitrary
JavaScript in other users' browsers.

Impact:
An attacker could steal session tokens, perform actions on behalf
of users, or redirect users to malicious sites.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Create a new message in any channel
2. Insert the following payload: <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
3. Send the message
4. Observe that the JavaScript executes when other users view the message

Proof of Concept:
[Screenshot or video showing the vulnerability]

Suggested Fix:
Ensure all user-generated content is properly sanitized using
DOMPurify before rendering. The TipTap editor should be configured
to strip script tags.

## Security Headers

ɳChat implements comprehensive security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Our CSP implementation uses a strict policy with nonce-based script execution:

```
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}' 'strict-dynamic';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' data: blob: https:;
  font-src 'self' data:;
  connect-src 'self' wss: {GRAPHQL_URL} {AUTH_URL};
  media-src 'self' blob:;
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self';
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  upgrade-insecure-requests;
  report-uri /api/csp-report
```

**Key Protections:**

- **script-src**: Only allows scripts from our domain and inline scripts with valid nonces
- **'strict-dynamic'**: Allows dynamically loaded scripts from trusted sources
- **object-src 'none'**: Blocks Flash and other plugins
- **frame-ancestors 'none'**: Prevents clickjacking (equivalent to X-Frame-Options: DENY)
- **upgrade-insecure-requests**: Automatically upgrades HTTP to HTTPS
- **report-uri**: Sends violation reports to `/api/csp-report` for monitoring

**Development vs Production:**

- Development allows `'unsafe-eval'` for hot module replacement
- Production removes `'unsafe-eval'` for maximum security
- CSP reporting only enabled in production

### X-Frame-Options

```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

Prevents the application from being embedded in iframes, protecting against clickjacking attacks.

### X-Content-Type-Options

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

Prevents MIME-type sniffing, forcing browsers to respect the declared Content-Type.

### Referrer-Policy

```
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests:

- Same-origin: Full URL is sent
- Cross-origin HTTPS: Only origin is sent
- Cross-origin HTTP: No referrer is sent

### Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

Forces browsers to only use HTTPS connections:

- **max-age=63072000**: 2 years
- **includeSubDomains**: Applies to all subdomains
- **preload**: Eligible for browser preload lists

**Note:** Only enabled in production to avoid HTTPS issues during local development.

### Permissions-Policy

```
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

Disables browser features that aren't needed, reducing attack surface.

### X-DNS-Prefetch-Control

```
X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: on
```

Controls DNS prefetching for improved performance while maintaining security.

## CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured with security best practices.

### Development Mode

In development, CORS is permissive to allow testing:

```typescript
{
  origin: '*',
  credentials: false
}
```

### Production Mode

In production, CORS is restrictive with explicit origin validation:

```typescript
{
  origin: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, // e.g., 'https://nchat.app'
  credentials: true, // Allows cookies/auth headers
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  headers: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}
```

**Security Rules:**

1. ✅ **Never use `origin: '*'` with `credentials: true`** in production
2. ✅ **Always specify explicit allowed origins** for production APIs
3. ✅ **Validate origin** before setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
4. ✅ **Include 'Vary: Origin'** header for proper caching
5. ✅ **Reject requests** from disallowed origins when credentials are enabled

### Pattern Matching

Supports wildcard subdomain patterns:

```typescript
origin: ['https://nchat.app', '*.nchat.app']
```

This allows `https://app.nchat.app` and `https://admin.nchat.app` but blocks others.

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { withCors, compose } from '@/lib/api/middleware'

// Public API endpoint (no credentials)
export const GET = withCors({
  origin: '*',
  credentials: false,
})(handler)

// Authenticated API endpoint
export const POST = compose(
  withErrorHandler,
  withCors({
    origin: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL,
    credentials: true,
  }),
  withAuth
)(handler)
```

## CSP Violation Reporting

CSP violations are automatically reported to `/api/csp-report` for monitoring.

### Violation Report Format

```json
{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "https://nchat.app/chat",
    "violated-directive": "script-src",
    "blocked-uri": "https://evil.com/malicious.js",
    "source-file": "https://nchat.app/chat",
    "line-number": 42,
    "column-number": 15
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Integration

In production, violations should be sent to a monitoring service:

**Sentry:**

```typescript
Sentry.captureMessage('CSP Violation', {
  level: 'warning',
  extra: violation,
})
```

**DataDog:**

```typescript
await fetch('https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/v1/input', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'DD-API-KEY': process.env.DATADOG_API_KEY,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    ddsource: 'browser',
    ddtags: 'env:production,service:nchat',
    message: 'CSP Violation',
    ...violation,
  }),
})
```

**CloudWatch:**

```typescript
await cloudwatch.putLogEvents({
  logGroupName: '/nchat/csp-violations',
  logStreamName: 'violations',
  logEvents: [
    {
      message: JSON.stringify(violation),
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    },
  ],
})
```

### Common Violations

| Violation   | Cause                     | Resolution                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| script-src  | Third-party script        | Add to CSP or use nonce           |
| style-src   | Inline styles             | Use Tailwind classes or add nonce |
| connect-src | API call to new domain    | Add domain to connect-src         |
| img-src     | Image from blocked source | Proxy images or add source        |

## Security Scanning

### Automated CI Checks

Every pull request runs security scans:

```yaml
- name: Run dependency audit
  run: pnpm audit --audit-level=high

- name: Run security check script
  run: bash scripts/security-check.sh
```

These checks are **blocking** - PRs cannot merge if vulnerabilities are found.

### Manual Security Audit

Run comprehensive security check:

```bash
bash scripts/security-check.sh
```

This checks:

1. Dependency vulnerabilities (npm audit)
2. Environment configuration
3. TypeScript type safety
4. Security headers configuration
5. Sensitive files in git
6. Docker security
7. Kubernetes security contexts
8. SSL/TLS configuration
9. Input validation
10. Rate limiting
